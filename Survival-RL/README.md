# Resource-Constrained Survival Environment  

## Overview  
This project creates a 2D grid world where a single agent must balance **exploration** (finding resources) and **exploitation** (using known resources) to survive. The environment features land masses divided by rivers, with resources like berries (short-term sustenance), wood (tool crafting), and animals (high-reward food).  

## Key Features  
- **Agent Attributes**: Hunger level and inventory for resources and tools.  
- **Actions**: Move, collect resources, craft tools, hunt animals, and cross rivers.  
- **Challenges**: Balancing resource prioritization and planning for survival.  

## Research Focus  
- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: Study how agents decide between discovering new resources and using current knowledge.  
- **Applications**: Insights into ecological sustainability, disaster response, and resource management.  

This environment provides a sandbox to experiment with RL algorithms and explore strategies for optimal survival in constrained settings.
